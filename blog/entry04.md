# A-frame
##### 2/12/2024

I picked A-frame because A-frame is based on HTML and I know how to use HTML. Before I started to tinker I copied and pasted the HTML code. The code was the base, it had everything set up. I tinker by using jsbin. I tinker with the position, the shape, the size, and the color. Tinkering with A-frame I realized that it is fun and cool because I get to make 3D shapes. 

### Content for A-frame

A-frame is based on top of **HTML** file without having to install anything and that makes things simple to get started. Based on A-frame website it says that A-frame is a web framework for **building virtual reality experiences**. It also says that A-frame is not just a 3D scene graph or a markup language, it's a core in something more powerful. It can _entity-component_ framework that can provide: _**delcarative, extensible, and composable structure to `three.js`.**_ 

### Content

I picked `A-frame` because A-frame is based on **HTML** and I know how to use HTML since 9th grade. However, that wasn't the only reason why I picked A-frame. I picked A-frame because A-frame is known for building virlual reality experiences and I'm quite interested in VR stuff because it seems to be very cool. Creating a new world just by writing down a code and with A-frame that is possible to do. So, that is why I picked A-frame for a reason. Also, my SEP teacher told that A-frame is a good website to learn and tinker with. 

### Sources

When I was tinkering with A-frame the only place that I did it in was **jsbin**. I copied that code that was provided for me in the A-frame website and once I pasted it to **jsbin** that's when I started to tinker. I started to added more 3D shapes, change the positioning, and I also changed up some colors.
