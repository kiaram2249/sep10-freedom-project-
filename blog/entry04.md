# A-frame
##### 2/12/2024

I picked A-frame because A-frame is based on HTML and I know how to use HTML. Before I started to tinker I copied and pasted the HTML code. The code was the base, it had everything set up. I tinker by using jsbin. I tinker with the position, the shape, the size, and the color. Tinkering with A-frame I realized that it is fun and cool because I get to make 3D shapes. 

### Content for A-frame

A-frame is based on top of **HTML** file without having to install anything and that makes things simple to get started. Based on A-frame website it says that A-frame is a web framework for **building virtual reality experiences**. It also says that A-frame is not just a 3D scene graph or a markup language, it's a core in something more powerful. It can _entity-component_ framework that can provide: _**declarative, extensible, and composable structure to `three.js`.**_ 

### Content

I picked `A-frame` because A-frame is based on **HTML** and I know how to use HTML since 9th grade. However, that wasn't the only reason why I picked A-frame. I picked A-frame because A-frame is known for building virlual reality experiences and I'm quite interested in VR stuff because it seems to be very cool. Creating a new world just by writing down a code and with A-frame that is possible to do. So, that is why I picked A-frame for a reason. Also, my SEP teacher told that A-frame is a good website to learn and tinker with.

When I was tinkering with A-frame the only place that I did it in was **jsbin**. I copied that code that was provided for me in the A-frame website and once I pasted it to **jsbin** that's when I started to tinker. I started to added more 3D shapes, change the positioning, and I also changed up some colors.

### Engineering Design Process
Since I am done with step 2 (researching) I have to start thinking about brainstorming. I am starting to go into step 3 (brainstorming). I am still in step 3 (brainstorming) because I still have to brainstorm on how I want my website to look like. So, by looking at A-frame and learning how to use plus understanding it, I can probably use it in making my website. So, for now I'm still working on step 3 and I think that I will still be on this step for a while since we haven't started making our website yet. However, I may need to take a step back because I can use the research in what I can do for my future website. For instance, the design, the color, what works better or not for my website, etc.

### Skills

#### Collaboration

I gained the skill of **Collaboration** because since I picked `A-frame` I also knew other people who were picking A-frame as well. For instance, my friend Caron was doing A-frame and together we were exploring the website and we were tinkering together as well. We helped each other out a bit with somethings. 

### Professionalism

I'm conveying my learning by using all of the things that I have learnt from my teacher, my friends, the google slides, and the previous 10th and 11th graders examples. However, next time I should try using github the `cs50.dev` in order to do my blogs, because I can get a lot more practice by doing that. Also, I should try practicing A-frame by using my `IDE` and `cs50.dev`.
