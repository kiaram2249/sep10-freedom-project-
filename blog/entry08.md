### Content

I learned so much from this long year. I learnt the basics of **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, **A-frame**, **Free-bootstrap templates**, and many other different tools. However, with these skills I was able to make my free ever website for my **Freedom Project**. I had fun making it and as some challenges becuase it took me some time to make and design my website. My website is about **Criminology**, and I had to make a website about what types of **Software & Hardware** that criminologies use in order to solve crime. As well I had to come up with new future technologies that can be helpful for them as well. 

Once I was finished with my website as well as my peers, we had to get ready for the **Expo** and we had to get ready for our in-class presentation. First we had to make our slides so that we can present them, while we were doing that we were also getting ready for the **Expo**. The **Expo** was on **May 29,2024** and to be honest I thought it would be very scarey but it turn out that it was actually fun. I had fun showing and explaining my website to people in **HSTAT**. I was a bit nervous when the judges came and saw my website, but it wasn't to bad at all. I'm kind of happy that I did joy **SEP** and was able to do this **Expo**.

### Engineering Design Process

Since I am done with my **Freedom Project** the step that I am at is **step 7 & step 8**. Step 7 is **Improve** and step 8 is **Communicate**. I'm in step 7 because I'm gonna try to improve my website and myself as well so that I can be ready for next year SEP class. I want to improve my **HTML**, **CSS**, and the many tools that I learnt. I'm in step 8 because since I have presented my website to my peers and in the **expo**, I am now getting my result ans feedback that I have gotten from my teachers and peers. 

### Skills

#### Communication

I learnt the skill **communication** by speaking in public and presenting my website to different grades in **HSTAT** from the **Expo**, as well s peaking in front of my peers. This skill is very helpful because now I can speck to other people and present in front of them without feeling nervous a lot. This skill help me present/speak in front of 9th graders, talking about why they should join **SEP**.

#### Collboration

I learnt the skill **collboration** by asking my peers and friends for help anytime I was stuck or having a challenge with my code/website. I really like learning this skill because without collboration I wouldn't have been able to over my challenges or gain advice from other peoples perspective. It's always nice to ask for help and relie on others.
