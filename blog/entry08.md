### Content

I learned so much from this long year. I learnt the basics of **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, **A-frame**, **Free-bootstrap templates**, and many other different tools. However, with these skills I was able to make my free ever website for my **Freedom Project**. I had fun making it and as some challenges becuase it took me some time to make and design my website. My website is about **Criminology**, and I had to make a website about what types of **Software & Hardware** that criminologies use in order to solve crime. As well I had to come up with new future technologies that can be helpful for them as well. 

Once I was finished with my website as well as my peers, we had to get ready for the **Expo** and we had to get ready for our in-class presentation. First we had to make our slides so that we can present them, while we were doing that we were also getting ready for the **Expo**. The **Expo** was on **May 29,2024** and to be honest I thought it would be very scarey but it turn out that it was actually fun. I had fun showing and explaining my website to people in **HSTAT**. I was a bit nervous when the judges came and saw my website, but it wasn't to bad at all. I'm kind of happy that I did joy **SEP** and was able to do this **Expo**.
