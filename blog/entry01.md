<h2>Why the topic of Criminology?</h2>

The topic that I have chosen for the year long project is **Criminology**. I chose Criminology because I have always been interested in crime and what people do at a crime scene. I always wondered how they do it, what they do, and what they use in order to solve a crime. I've been obsessed with criminology since I was little, and I always watch _`documentary`_ about crime, and I always used to watch a TV show called _`Criminal Minds`_. Plus, I would like to know more about criminology and the process that goes into it. Also, I would like to know how technologies have helped people who are in criminology, and how they developed over time + helping solve crimes. In addition, I may decide to take criminology as a career in the future or somewhere around that field. 

Some links that I used to explore were [What is Criminology?](https://online.maryville.edu/online-bachelors-degrees/criminal-justice/resources/what-is-criminology/#:~:text=Criminology%20is%20the%20study%20of,of%20people%20who%20commit%20crimes) , [About Criminoloy](https://www.liveabout.com/what-is-criminology-974589) , [How Technology Is Used for Criminal Investigations](https://www.openfox.com/how-technology-is-used-for-criminal-investigations/#:~:text=Law%20enforcement%20officials%20use%20data,them%20in%20their%20criminal%20investigations) and [The Role of Social Media and Technology in Criminology](https://samples.freshessays.com/the-role-of-social-media-and-technology-in-criminology.html) All the articles / websites were interesting and very informative. The articles `What is Criminology` and `About Criminoloy` further explain what is Criminoloy more in depth. It helped me understand what is criminoloy, and what it's about. While the other two articles / website explain how technology were used and how it is helpful in criminal investigation and criminoloy. 

<h2>Engineering Design Process</h2>

Right now I'm at Step 1 (defining) and Step 2 (researching). Last week we were defining what we wanted to do and what career interested us. We were trying to pick 3 topics that we were passionate about, and then we picked our 1st topic that we were interested to write about. After we have chosen a topic we go into a deep search, researching about that topic and how technology has helped that career. However, for now I am still working on Step 2 (researching), I am trying to find more articles, and websites for my topic and how technology helped my topic. So, before I move on to Step 3, I want to still take my time and work on Step 2 for the time being.
