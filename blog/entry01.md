<h2>Why the topic of Criminology?</h2>

The topic that I have chosen for the year long project is **Criminology**. I chose Criminology because I have always been interested in crime and what people do at a crime scene. I always wondered how they do it, what they do, and what they use in order to solve a crime. I've been obsessed with criminology since I was little, and I always watch _`documentary`_ about crime, and I always used to watch a TV show called _`Criminal Minds`_. Plus, I would like to know more about criminology and the process that goes into it. Also, I would like to know how technologies have helped people who are in criminology, and how they developed over time + helping solve crimes. In addition, I may decide to take criminology as a career in the future or somewhere around that field. 

Some links that I used to explore were [What is Criminology?](https://online.maryville.edu/online-bachelors-degrees/criminal-justice/resources/what-is-criminology/#:~:text=Criminology%20is%20the%20study%20of,of%20people%20who%20commit%20crimes) , [About Criminoloy](https://www.liveabout.com/what-is-criminology-974589) , [How Technology Is Used for Criminal Investigations](https://www.openfox.com/how-technology-is-used-for-criminal-investigations/#:~:text=Law%20enforcement%20officials%20use%20data,them%20in%20their%20criminal%20investigations) and [The Role of Social Media and Technology in Criminology](https://samples.freshessays.com/the-role-of-social-media-and-technology-in-criminology.html) All the articles / websites were interesting and very informative. The articles `What is Criminology` and `About Criminology` further explain what is Criminology in more depth. It helped me understand what criminology is, and what it's about. While the other two articles / websites `How Technology Is Used for Criminal Investigations` and `The Role of Social Media and Technology in Criminology` explain how technology was used and how it is helpful in criminal investigation and criminology. Plus, the benefits of working with technology. 

<h2>Engineering Design Process</h2>

Right now I'm at Step 1 (defining) and Step 2 (researching). Last week we were defining what we wanted to do and what career interested us. We were trying to pick 3 topics that we were passionate about, and then we picked our 1st topic that we were interested to write about. After we have chosen a topic we go into a deep search, researching about that topic and how technology has helped that career. However, for now I am still working on Step 2 (researching), I am trying to find more articles, and websites for my topic and how technology helped my topic. So, before I move on to Step 3, I want to still take my time and work on Step 2 for the time being. 

<h2>Skills</h2>

Some skills that I have learned from working on this blog are **How to read**, **Attention to detail**, and **Collaboration**

<h4>How to read</h4>

When I was in google searching for the articles or the websites, I knew which ones to look at because my BHP teacher taught me how to research things online and how to tell which ones are useful and reliable. She taught us how to tell if the article or website is good or not. She told us that we should look at where the website / article is made from. Fr instance, the _"What is Criminology"_ it was made from an university. She also told us to look into the publisher of the articles or websites and to see if the publisher is reliable and is knowledgeable to the topic. 

<h4>Attention to detail</h4>

Every time I was writing down a code or writing about the topic, I would always make sure that there were no typos or no incorrect codes. For making sure I wasn't making any typos I would always copy and paste what I wrote and put it into a google doc form, so that the auto correction can show up so that I can fix my writing. However, to make sure that I have no incorrect codes I would ask one of my friends to reread what I wrote and to look over my codes to make sure that I have written them correctly. Or I would go to my notes or slides to make sure that I have written my code correctly as well. 

<h4>Collaboration</h4>

For collaboration, I learnt that it is ok to ask for help from time to time, and that working with a pair can be beneficial for me and for my partner as well. Collaboration also helped me with my communication skills a bit because in order to collaborate I need to know how to communicate as well. Without the communication skill I wouldn't be able to collaborate with others. It also helped me because I was able to get other people's opinions and feedback, and that helped me improve in some ways. 

<h2>Professionalism</h2>

I'm conveying my learning by using all the things that I have learnt from my teachers, from `Tiny.cc/fccwd`, from `Html`, from `Markdown`, and from my friends as well. I have learnt many different kinds of coding and format and how to use them as well. I am using all of my learning and coding skills in order to make this first blog. I have used some of the html codes for instance I used the headers `<h1></h1>`. As well I used some of the markdown codes, for example I used this `*` to make my words in bold, I used `_` in order to make some words in italic and I also used the code snippet as well.
