<h2>Why the topic of Criminology?</h2>

The topic that I have chosen for the year long project is **Criminology**. I chose Criminology because I have always been interested in crime and what people do at a crime scene. I always wondered how they do it, what they do, and what they use in order to solve a crime. I've been obsessed with criminology since I was little, and I always watch _`documentary`_ about crime, and I always used to watch a TV show called _`Criminal Minds`_. Plus, I would like to know more about criminology and the process that goes into it. Also, I would like to know how technologies have helped people who are in criminology, and how they developed over time + helping solve crimes. In addition, I may decide to take criminology as a career in the future.
