### What is Criminology:

### How technology is used & how it's helpful in criminal investigation and criminology:

* [How Technology Is Used for Criminal Investigations](https://www.openfox.com/how-technology-is-used-for-criminal-investigations/#:~:text=Law%20enforcement%20officials%20use%20data,them%20in%20their%20criminal%20investigations)
* [The Role of Social Media and Technology in Criminology](https://samples.freshessays.com/the-role-of-social-media-and-technology-in-criminology.html).

Criminology uses technology in order to help them when investigating. Criminology uses `Software` and `Hardware` technology. So, into today's **Blog:2** I am gonna write down what I have recorded from the past week or month. I'm gonna write down what types of `software` and `hardware` technology that Criminology uses when investigating.  

## Criminology Software:

When I was first doing my research about `Criminology Software` the first thing that I decided to search in Google was **Criminology Technology Software**. Once I searched that up the first thing that I saw was [How Technology Is Used for Criminal Investigations](https://www.openfox.com/how-technology-is-used-for-criminal-investigations/). This website was reliable to me because it had parts explaining and showing what types of softwares technology that Criminology uses when doing investigations. 

* Facial Recognition Software:
   * "`Facial recognition` technology is capable of matching human faces from video frames or digital images against a database of faces."
   * `Retina & Fingerprint Scans`

After I was done looking into that website I decided to look even further. While looking through Google I came across another website called, [8 Types Of Police Software And Their Uses](https://www.openfox.com/8-types-of-police-software-and-their-uses/ ). This website went even more deeper because in this website it showed me different other software technologies that Criminology uses. 

### Software Technologies:

* Background Check Software
* Investigation Software
* Facial Recognition Software
* Case Management Software
* Reporting Software
* Citation Software
* Scheduling Software
* Database Software

## Criminology Hardware:
 
When I was done looking into software technologies that Criminology uses, it was now time to look at Hardware. This time instead of looking at **software** I was gonna look at different **hardwares** that Criminology uses when doing investigations. So, the first thing that I did when going to Google was searching up `Criminology Hardware`. However, when I searched that up I realized that there wasn't that much information about it. So, I decided to do a bit more of a deep search. Instead of me searching up **Criminology Hardware** I instead searched up `What sort of Hardware do Criminologist use`. Once I did that I found an website called [What Are Criminologist Skills?](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/criminologist-skills ). This website explained what Criminology is and the technology they use a bit. 

* Technology:
   * “Some criminologists may work with complicated technology to analyze large amounts of data. They may also use computers to create readable reports. Although the technical requirements may vary, a career as a criminologist may require basic computer skills or competency.”

This website was good, but it didn't gave a lot of information that much. So, I went to google again and searched even more. I searched up `Hardware technology used for Criminology`, once I searched that up I found my second website. [Criminology Equipment](https://princevaliant-equip.com/product-category/criminology-equipment/), this website was very informative because in this website it showed many Hardware technologies that Criminology uses. This helped me find out what kind of Hardware that Criminology uses when investgating. 

* Bullet Recovery Box
* Angle Finder
* Classification Magnifier 
* Digital Polygraph 
* Fumehood
* Forensic Optical Comparator
* Etc 

#### Other:

* While doing my research I was able to find a youtube video on what type of Hardware that Criminology uses.

# Engineering Design Process

Right now I am still in Step 2 (researching). I am still researching because I had to research what `Software` and `Hardware` that Crimimnology uses. I think I'm still gonna be in the Step 2 because I still need to research a bit more information so that it can help me with the next step. The next step would be **Step 3** `Brainstorm`. For that step I would have to brainstorm a possible solutions. However, it would take me some time for me to get to that next step. So, for now I'm gonna work on my research a bit more. 

# Skills

### How to read

While searching in Goolge for websites or articles, I knew which onces to look at because my BHP teacher taught me how to research things online. She also taught us how to tell which ones are useful and reliable. So, when searching for websites I need to look at who made it, who that person is, and if the website is reliable or not. 

### Attention to detail
Every time I was writing down a code or writing about the topic, I would always make sure that there were no typos or no incorrect codes. For making sure I wasn't making any typos I would always copy and paste what I wrote and put it into a google doc form, so that the auto correction can show up so that I can fix my writing. However, to make sure that I have no incorrect codes I would ask one of my friends to reread what I wrote and to look over my codes to make sure that I have written them correctly. Or I would go to my notes or slides to make sure that I have written my code correctly as well.

# Professionalism

I'm conveying my learning by using all the things that I have learnt from my teachers, from `Tiny.cc/fccwd`, from `Html`, from `Markdown`, and from my friends as well. I have learnt many different kinds of coding and format and how to use them as well. I used some markdown codes in order to write my blog number 2. I used `**(example)**` in order to make my words go bold, I used `* (example)` in order to make bullet points, and `code snippet` in order to snippet my codes, a words or a sentence. All of those codes I learnt them from **Markdown**.
