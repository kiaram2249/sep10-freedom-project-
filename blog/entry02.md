### How technology is used & how it's helpful in criminal investigation and criminology:

* [How Technology Is Used for Criminal Investigations](https://www.openfox.com/how-technology-is-used-for-criminal-investigations/#:~:text=Law%20enforcement%20officials%20use%20data,them%20in%20their%20criminal%20investigations)
* [The Role of Social Media and Technology in Criminology](https://samples.freshessays.com/the-role-of-social-media-and-technology-in-criminology.html).

Criminology uses technology in order to help them when investigating. Criminology uses `Software` and `Hardware` technology. So, into today's **Blog:2** I am gonna write down what I have recorded from the past week or month. I'm gonna write down what types of `software` and `hardware` technology that Criminology uses when investigating.  

## Criminology Software:

When I was first doing my research about `Criminology Software` the first thing that I decided to search in Google was **Criminology Technology Software**. Once I searched that up the first thing that I saw was [How Technology Is Used for Criminal Investigations](https://www.openfox.com/how-technology-is-used-for-criminal-investigations/). This website was reliable to me because it had parts explaining and showing what types of softwares technology that Criminology uses when doing investigations. 

* Facial Recognition Software:
   * "`Facial recognition` technology is capable of matching human faces from video frames or digital images against a database of faces."
   * `Retina & Fingerprint Scans`

After I was done looking into that website I decided to look even further. While looking through Google I came across another website called, [8 Types Of Police Software And Their Uses](https://www.openfox.com/8-types-of-police-software-and-their-uses/ ). This website went even more deeper because in this website it showed me different other software technologies that Criminology uses. 

### Software Technologies:

* Background Check Software
* Investigation Software
* Facial Recognition Software
* Case Management Software
* Reporting Software
* Citation Software
* Scheduling Software
* Database Software

## Criminology Hardware:
 
When I was done looking into software technologies that Criminology uses, it was now time to look at Hardware. This time instead of looking at **software** I was gonna look at different **hardwares** that Criminology uses when doing investigations. So, the first thing that I did when going to Google was searching up `Criminology Hardware`. However, when I searched that up I realized that there wasn't that much information about it. So, I decided to do a bit more of a deep search. Instead of me searching up **Criminology Hardware** I instead searched up `What sort of Hardware do Criminologist use`. Once I did that I found an website called [What Are Criminologist Skills?](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/criminologist-skills ). This website explained what Criminology is and the technology they use a bit. 
* Technology:
   * “Some criminologists may work with complicated technology to analyze large amounts of data. They may also use computers to create readable reports. Although the technical requirements may vary, a career as a criminologist may require basic computer skills or competency.”
This website was good, but it didn't gave a lot of information that much. So, I went to google again and searched even more. I searched up `Hardware technology used for Criminology`, once I searched that up I found my second website. [Criminology Equipment](https://princevaliant-equip.com/product-category/criminology-equipment/), this website was very informative because in this website it showed many Hardware technologies that Criminology uses. This helped me find out what kind of Hardware that Criminology uses when investgating. 

* Bullet Recovery Box
* Angle Finder
* Classification Magnifier 
* Digital Polygraph 
* Fumehood
* Forensic Optical Comparator
* Etc 

#### Other:

* While doing my research I was able to find a youtube video on what type of Hardware that Criminology uses.
