Criminology uses technology in order to help them when investigating. Criminology uses `Software` and `Hardware` technology. So, into today's **Blog:2** I am gonna write down what I have recorded from the past week or month. I'm gonna write down what types of `software` and `hardware` technology that Criminology uses when investigating.  

## Criminology Software:















Right now I'm at Step 1 (defining) and Step 2 (researching). Last week we were defining what we wanted to do and what career interested us. We were trying to pick 3 topics that we were passionate about, and then we picked our 1st topic that we were interested to write about. After we have chosen a topic we go into a deep search, researching about that topic and how technology has helped that career. However, for now I am still working on Step 2 (researching), I am trying to find more articles, and websites for my topic and how technology helped my topic. So, before I move on to Step 3, I want to still take my time and work on Step 2 for the time being.
