# Criminology

### Content Process

In order for me to come up with my content I had to brainstorm and gather details. I had to gather information about the different softwares and the different hardwares that Criminologist use in order to create the wedsite. Also, I had to brainstorm new ideas and new technology for the future so that Criminologist can use. It was kind of hard to think of new technology for the future because I had to think outside the box. I also had to think what was the purpose for that new technology. 


### Content 

#### What is Criminology
   * People that work as a criminologist do criminology. Criminology is the study of crime or criminal behavior. Criminologist do sociology, psychology, economics, statistics, and anthropology. Criminologist help solve crime and understand what had happened during the crime. When working as a criminologist they need to understand the human mind, their behavior and the crime itself.

   * Investigation Software
     * Useful in the investigative process.
   * Facial Recognition Software
     * Verify an individual identity remotely, and can identify unknown individuals in a photo or video.

   * “Some criminologists may work with complicated technology to analyze large amounts of data. They may also use computers to create readable reports. Although the technical requirements may vary, a career as a criminologist may require basic computer skills or competency.”

#### Future Ideas
* Studying Behavior
   * A technology that I want to create in the future is a technology that can read or analyze people's emotions. It will be a little or hand-holding device that you can scan on a person and it will give you the data of that person.
     * It will gather information about the person and it will gather the person's emotions.
     * I can also make the technology track whether the person is lying or not.
     * This can help criminology workers when they are studying a person's behavior.
* Studying Crime scenes
  * A technology that I want to create in the future is a technology that can make the predictions of what happened in the crime scene. It will help the workers get a sense of what happened or an idea of what happened.
    * This technology can give many outcomes of what happened and will organize the top 5 predictions of what could have happened.
    * The technology will be small and carryable so that the workers can bring it with them during a crime scene.
    * This device can even shoot a hologram making hologram people so that it can create the scene for the workers.
* Gathering data
  * This technology would be created to gather data for the workers. This technology is almost like when people scan a scanner code in order to go to that form or website. However, this device can scan anything like a person's phone or a weapon.
    * This device would scan an item that the worker placed and in a different screen all the data will be shown.
    * It would scan out the finger prints, the social media, the history, calls and texts, etc.
    * This technology would be in the workplace because it would be very big and very heavy to bring around.
    * The technology can help the criminologist because it can scan and check the person's social media.
* Analyzing people on the spot
  * This technology is a handcuff that analyzes people once they get handcuffs and it will show the cops the data about that person.
    * It will show the data to the cops, so that they can know their information. The cops would give this information to the criminologist and the workers.

### Engineering Design Process

Since I am done with step 2 (reseaching) I have to start thinking about brainstorming. I am starting to go into step 3 (brainstorming). I have to brainstorm what I want my website to have as its contents, I have to think what I want my content to be about. Also, I had to brainstorm the future technologies that criminologist can use. I had to come up with different technologies that make sense so that that in the future criminologist can use. I want to start brainstorming in how I want my website to look like, plus I want to fix my content a bit more so that it can be a bit more better. However, onto the next step I want to start planing and putting all of my ideas onto my website. 

### Skills

#### Attention to detail

I gain the skill of **Attention to detail** because I was focus on making sure that my content had all the information that was needed. Also, I was making sure that my ideas for the technologies made sense because I wanted to make sure that the technologies are useful to use in the future for criminologist. Plus, I wanted to makes sure that there were no typos onto my content and I wanted to make sure I used and included all of my information that was needed. 

#### Collaboration

I gained the skill of **Collaboration** because when I was trying to come up with new ideas for the technology part, I asked my friend Xue because we were almost working on the same topic. Xue helped me gain ideas and I also think that I helped her by gaining some ideas as well. Also, by collaborating with my friends it made things more easy for me to do my content and when I was trying to find my informations. 

#### Time management

I'm kind of working on my **Time management** because this is my blog 3 and it was suppose to be due Friday on the 22 of December. Turning this in late is not good because it shows my lack of time management. I want to work on my time management more because I want to be able to turn in my blogs in time no matter what. So, time management is something that I want to work on more so that it can be a skill that I can **use** and **master** in.

### Professionalism

I'm conveying my learning by using all of the things that I have learnt from my teacher, my friends, the google slides, and the previous 10th and 11th graders examples. Also, I'm conveying my learning by using `Tiny.cc/fccwd`,`Html`, and `Markdown` because the  things that I learnt from it was the different types of coding skills that I was able to use in order to make my blog 3. Maybe next time I should try using github the `cs50.dev` in order to do my blogs, because I can get a lot more practice by doing that.
