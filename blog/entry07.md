#### My thoughts on this MVP

This **MVP** was a year long project that I had to make over this year. Over these times we were learning how to use `Basic Web Designs` such as **HTML**, **CSS**, **Positioning**, **Geomerty**, and **Animation**. After we have learnt that we went on learning `Github` and the `Github comments`. And finally we learnt `Advanced Web Design`. All of these were helpful because it was preparing me for the moment I had to go make my **MVP**.

#### My process in getting my resources
###### Criminology 

Before we had to start our **MVP** I had to plan out what I wanted to put onto my **MVP**. I had to get information about my topic and I had to come up with new technologies for the future. This process was kind of hard and easy to do at the same time because getting iformation wasn't to hard but to be able to look at the many resources and pick them out was hard a bit. It was hard because when I would look at the different websites, some of the websites didn't provided the information that I was looking for. It was even harder when I had to find the different types of **software** that criminologies uses. But in the end I was able to do it because slowly over time I was able to gain the skill in **How to Google** and **Attention to Details**. 

#### My process in learning my tool
###### A-frame

`A-frame` was the tool that I pick. I picked `A-frame` because **A-frame** is based on **HTML** and I know how to use `HTML`. Also, based on the A-frame website it says that A-frame is a web framework for `building virtual reality experiences`. A-frame is such a interesting tool because you can play with 3D shapes and create a 3D world. However, learning how to use the tool A-frame was kind of a challenge because I had to look up YouTube and find videos. It was hard to find the videos because everytime I search up A-frame on YouTube it would show `how to put a picture onto a frame` and that's not what I wanted. So, I had to be very specific when I was searching up in `how to use A-frame` on YouTube. Once I found videos for **A-frame** I was able start tinkering and to start to fill in my learning log.

#### My process in making my MVP

Making my **MVP** was a challenge because I didn't know what to start on. There was so many things that I wanted to do but I just didn't know how to do it. So, for the first couple of days of making my **MVP** I first started to make a plan in the steps I'm gonna do. As well I went into **wireframe** so that I can plan out the layout in how I want my website to look like. After I did that I then began to start making my website. To be honest I went and use a **boostrap free templates** and I accidentally used an advance template. When I realized that I was using an advance template I stop using it and I decided to start all over. However, I did use the advance template as inspiration in how I want my website to work / look like. Once I was done making website I then began making my **A-frame**. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my **A-frame** but I did had some ideas in what I wanted to do with it. I wanted to make a "gallery walk" by using A-frame `<a-image> and <a-text>`. But I didn't know how to do that so I asked my friends since they were also using **A-frame**. So, we all decided to be on call and do A-frame together and help each other out. 

## Skills

#### How to Google

I learned the skill in **How to Google** because I had to google information about my topic and I had to find information on how to use A-frame. Over time I was slowly starting to know what to google and where to google it. So, that kind of help me over the long run because now I know how to google things in orber to get my information for something. 

#### Communication

I learned the skill **communication** because I was communicating with my peers and with my friends in how can I use my **A-frame** and how I should do my website. I would ask them question if I was stuck with something and we would communicate with each other and help one another. However, I think that I still need to improve on my communication skills a little bit more because I was only communicating with the people that I know. So, I need to slowly start communicating with other people that I don't know that can help me and that I can help them as well.
