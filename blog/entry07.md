#### My Thoughts on this MVP

This **MVP** was a year long project that I had to make over this year. Over these times we were learning how to use `Basic Web Designs` such as **HTML**, **CSS**, **Positioning**, **Geomerty**, and **Animation**. After we have learnt that we went one learning `Github` and the `Github comments`. ANd finally we learnt `Advanced Web Design`. All of these were helpful because it was preparing me for the moment I had to go make my **MVP**.
