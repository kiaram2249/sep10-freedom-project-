#### My thoughts on this MVP

This **MVP** was a year long project that I had to make over this year. Over these times we were learning how to use `Basic Web Designs` such as **HTML**, **CSS**, **Positioning**, **Geomerty**, and **Animation**. After we have learnt that we went one learning `Github` and the `Github comments`. ANd finally we learnt `Advanced Web Design`. All of these were helpful because it was preparing me for the moment I had to go make my **MVP**.

#### My process in getting my resources
###### Criminology 

Before we had to start our **MVP** I had to plan out what I wanted to put onto my **MVP**. I had to get information about my topic and I had to come up with new technologies for the future. This process was kind of hard and easy to do at the same time because getting iformation wasn't to hard but to be able to look at the many resources and pick them out was hard a bit. It was hard because when I would look at the different websites, some of the websites didn't previded the information that I was looking for. It was even harder when I had to find the different types of software that criminologies uses. But in the end I was able to do it because slowly over time I was able to gain the skill in **How to Google** and **Attention to Details**.
