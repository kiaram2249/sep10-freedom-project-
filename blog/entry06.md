### What did I learned about my tool:

While tinkering with **A-frame** I learned a lot of things and a lot new different **HTML** codes. I also learnt **SASS**, and **Animation** since some of the videos that I watched inclueded it. Besides just tinkering I also went to different websites like the **A-frame website** or **A-frame school**. I was looking into those websites because I wanted to gain a better understanding of A-frame and to see if I can learn how to do certain things. Which I did, I learnt many things about my tool. For instance, I learnt the **Component Method**, how to change color by using **programmatic animation**, setting the **posittion**, giving the sphere **context**, and setting **texture** to my 3D objects. As well what is a **entity**, what is a **component**, **system**, and **architecture**. 



A-frame is based on top of HTML file without having to install anything and that makes things simple to get started. Based on A-frame website it says that A-frame is a web framework for building virtual reality experiences. It also says that A-frame is not just a 3D scene graph or a markup language, it's a core in something more powerful. It can entity-component framework that can provide: declarative, extensible, and composable structure to three.js.
