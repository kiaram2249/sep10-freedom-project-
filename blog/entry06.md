# My Tool A-frame
##### 4/14/2024

### What did I learned about my tool:

While tinkering with **A-frame** I learned a lot of things and a lot new different **HTML** codes. I also learnt **SASS**, and **Animation** since some of the videos that I watched inclueded it. Besides just tinkering I also went to different websites like the **A-frame website** or **A-frame school**. I was looking into those websites because I wanted to gain a better understanding of A-frame and to see if I can learn how to do certain things. Which I did, I learnt many things about my tool. For instance, I learnt the **Component Method**, how to change color by using **programmatic animation**, setting the **posittion**, giving the sphere **context**, and setting **texture** to my 3D objects. As well what is a **entity**, what is a **component**, **system**, and **architecture**. 

#### What I learnt: 

Example in how to write down an **Entity**:
```
<a-entity component1="property1:value; property2:value;"><a-entity> 
```
```
<a-entity geometry="primitive:box" material="color:red" position="-1 0.5 -3"></a-entity>
```

Component Method
```
<a-entity id="lightSphere" geometry="primitive=sphere" material="color:white; shader: flat" light="type:point" position="-4 3 -10"></a-entity>
```

Animation when using **A-frame**
```
<html>
  <body>
    <a-scene>
      <a-box color="pink"
             position="0 0.5 0">
             <a-animation attribute="rotation"
                          to="0 360 0"
                          repeat="indefinite"
                          dur="1000">
             </a-animation>
      </a-box>
    </a-scene>
  </body>
</html>
```

### How you learned your tool:

I learnt my tool by going to **YouTUbe** and by going to two different **A-frame website**. However, I mostly learnt how to use my tool by watching many **YouTube** videos because in those videos the people talk about _What is A-frame?_, _How to use A-frame_, and the _Different ways in using A-frame_. They really did broke things down one by one and they show you how to write down the code. So, it's easy to follow alone with them and code the same thing with them. These videos also provide the sources that they used and when to go in order to find these learning sources.
