Tool: **A-frame**

---

2/26/2024:
* Today I decided to look into the **A-frame** website more because I wanted to grasp a better understanding of A-frame. I want to do this because last time when I was tinkering I didn't really looked over **A-frame** seriously.
  * [A-frame](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/)

3/3/2024:
* Today I decided to try to use my **IDE** in order to practice A-frame. However, something wasn't working because when I made a new _file / folder_ and copy and pasted the **A-frame html** code I thought that I can do my coding like that. But, once I did **http-server** and clicked on the link, nothing was showing up. I don't know why nothing was showing up but once I get back to school tommorrow I'll ask one of my friends or I'll just ask my teacher in how to practice A-frame by using my IDE.
* Questions:
  * How can I use A-frame by using my **IDE** or my **https://cs50.dev/**?
* Since I couldn't practice in my IDE I just went to practice A-frame in **js-bin**. I just practiced on how to make 3D shapes and I try to memorized how to write a piece of the code. I also, tried to wonder what if I do that or change this. Meaning I was trying to see what would happen if I were to put this or change something from the A-frame code.
* Next time I'm gonna do a mini website practice and trying to see what my website would look like if I used A-frame. Or I can start trying to make my website by using A-frame. Basically drawing out a plan in how my website would like if I use A-frame.
