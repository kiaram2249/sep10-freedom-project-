## Timeline

#### MVP

* Today I will try to make my website for a desktop device. Maybe I will use a temple as my base so that I can gain an idea in how I want my website to look like.
* Today I'll only work on my website for now because I still need a bit more time in what I want to do with my A-frame.
* If I'm done with making my website in the next couple of days, maybe I will start making my website go into a mobile device so that people with desktop / mobile size decive can access both.
* TBC

#### Beyond MVP

* Having a 3D mobel in A-frame showing the different current technologies that people use today for Criminology.
