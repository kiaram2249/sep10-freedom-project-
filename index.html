Criminologist do sociology, psychology, economics, statistics, and anthropology. Criminologist help solve crime and understand what had happened during the crime.

            <h4 class="txt">Software & Hardware</h4>
            <p class="write">Criminologists uses both software and hardware technologies so that they can analyze large amount of data. Both software and hardware are very useful because each are used for different purposes. Also, criminologists may require basic computer skills or competency since because they use software technologies.</p>

            <p class="write">I want to propose some technologies that can be made for the future. I created some ideas in what can be made for the future that criminologists can use. I wanted to improve the technologies that we had today and further create something new or something better because maybe these ideas will help criminologists when they are doing their jobs.</p>

<p class="write">These are some examples of the type of software that criminologist uses so that they can help and solve crimes. Software technologies are advancing and becoming very useful. I know that I'm just showing three different types of softwares but their are many other more softwares that they use. For instance, Monitoring Systems, Voice Command Techology, Investigation Software, Case Management Software, Reporting Software, Scheduling Software, and Database Software. These software are very useful because it helps solve crimes and check backgrounds on people and other things as well.</p>

Without hardware criminologist wouldn't be able to collect data or evdience so that that they can build up a case or be able to sovle the crimes. However, their are many other more hardware technologies that criminologist uses such as Angle Finder, Fumehood, Forensic Optical Comparator, Compass, Crime Scene Marking Kit, Crime Scene Sketch Kit, Document Verification Machine, and Forensic Bullet Comparison Microscope.</p>
